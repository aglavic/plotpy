----------- 0 - introduction --------------
This is the fourth release of scripts for plotting mpms/ppms, 4Circle, reflectometer, treff, dns and some more file formats.
The main goal of this project is to create one framework for common data evaluation of a bunch of instuments
so that common tasks are automated and the user saves a lot of time. Many people use gnuplot and with this
program you can create nice gnuplot graphs quite fast and change the gnuplot script after exporting it.
For a description of the features see chapter 3. 
Version 0.7 is a huge step in functionality and usability. A lot of new features have been implemented and the old ones
have been polished. The basic data structure has been reworked to be much faster and advanced.
This version also introduces an ineractive ipython console, which can be used to run own scripts to interfere with the program
interactively or to perform operations on the data. (For this purpose the new PhysicalProperty class which is used to store
the data internally can be quite helpful.)

The following list of changes does not claim to be complete:

----- 1    - changes since version 0.7 -----
- Support for 4-ID-C datatype of APS
- Added templates support in GUI, user can define an ASCII file format with a simple template file.
- Added experimental mouse support for mapplots under Linux.
- Completed the "PlotTree" Dilaog, which shows a list of all plots including preview.
- Improved GUI useablinity with e.g. important dialogs reappear at their last used position
- IPython console improvements:
  - Script lines can be automatically run at startup using the "-ipy" and "-ipr" command line parameters
  - Keyboard shortcuts get redirected to the main window, e.g. <control>+N changes to the next plot
  - Important mathematic functions as 'exp' and 'sin' are directly added to the namespace without using the np. prefix.
  - 'ls' and 'cat' functions now use python functions as the result had not been shown in the program but the Unix console.
  - GUI Menu functions are directly aveilable via the new 'menus' object.
- Fix a bug making plotting impossible with Gnuplot versions <4.4
- Fix small bug which could raise an error on unix systems where it should have been cought (WindowsError not defined)

----- 1.1 - changes from version 0.6.3 to 0.7 -------
- For gnuplot version >=4.4 mouse support was added for 2d plots including position status message, 
  zoom functionality, adding labels on shift+click and fitting peak functions on ctrl+click.
- Added template framework to fast create new datatypes.
- Added MARIA, D7, general SPEC and IN17 datatype.
- Added possibilty to derivate data using a moving window (Savitzky-Golay filter) or global (FFT) approach.
- Added rebinning and smoothing options for 3d (map) data.
- Added fit for 3d (map) datasets.
- Added color selection dialog showing the available color scales.
- Added some new fit functions.
- Added FFT analysis of reflectivity measurements.
- Export, apply options and print multple datasets together, which can be selected with previews.
- Added a DataView dialog to show the data of the active plot in a table.
- Possibility to update the program from a website (updatescript itself needs to be written, but will be downloaded
  automatically)
- Updated Polarized Neutron Reflectivity fit program from Emmanuel Kentzinger
- Rework the data output leading to a speedup in plotting of 70-95%.
- Rework of the MeasurementData and PhysicalProperty objects which store the data, now the columns storing data are
  derived from the numpy.ndarray object, which make calculations a lot faster and gives the possiblity to use them with
  numpy universal functions.
- Added program icons in the system menu and file type assignment (Windows/Debian package)
- Fix rescaling the program window
- Fix some unicode issues
- Improved error handling and debug.log
- A lot of bugfixes.

- added possibility to open the GUI without datafile so it can be run from the menu (.deb and windows

- interactive reflectometer fitting, using the fit.f90 back end by E. Kentzinger (modified)
- a lot more of minor improvements


----------- 2 - installation (Linux) --------------
See http://iffwww.iff.kfa-juelich.de/~glavic/plotwiki for more information

!!!On Debian systems I recommand to use the debian package available via the wiki download page.!!!

plotting-scripts:
1. Extract Plot-script-{VERSION}.tar.gz to any destination folder:

  tar -xvvzf Plot-script-{VERSION}.tar.gz

  You now have two options, link the script to your bin-directory and run it from this folder or install it as python module(recomanded):

2a- Link the script using the install shell script:
  In the folder type:
    ./install
  
  this creates symbolic links for plot.py, plot_4circle_data, plot_reflectometer_data, 
  plot_SQUID_data (scripts) and p4d,prd,pld (gui mode) in /usr/bin .
  !! if you don't have administrator priviliges, use ./install {PATH} , with a directory {PATH}
     inside one of your system path folders. (type "print $PATH" to find out where to look)

  To remove the script is just as easy, go to the installation folder and type
    ./uninstall
  this will remove the symbolic links. If you installed to another path, use uninstall with
  the same parameters as the install script earlier.

  !!! If you have the previous version installed, you have !!!
  !!! to uninstall it first, as the links have changed.    !!!
  For full functionality you will need the gfortran compiler(fit.f90), gnuplot.py(speedup) and pygtk(GUI) packages.


2b- Run the installtion with python:

  python setup.py install
  
  this creates scripts to run the program
  ! if you don't have administrator priviliges, use 
      python setup.py install --prefix {Inst.Dir} --install-scripts {folder in your path}
      inside one of your system path folders. (type "print $PATH" to find out where to look)

  For full functionality you will need the gfortran compiler(fit.f90), numpy, scipy and pygtk(GUI) packages.

----------- 2.1 - installation (Windows) --------------
As installation from source is quite complicated on windows I skip to provide this information here.

!!! I recommand to use the package installer available on the wiki download page. !!!!

If you still want to try installing from source please reffer to the wiki page for more information.

------- 3 - goals for later releases -------
The next releases will hopefully come in about 3-6 month cycles. 
At the moment I have these plans for the future releases:
!!! Please give me feedback, thats the only way for me to find errors 
     arising from differnt input options/operating systems !!!

  v0.8) 
        - replace the multiplot functionality by a plot dialog which is easier to use and has
          additional functionality as to plot more than one column of a file, still no idea how
        - save more settings in the config file, savable window profiles, more user control on the
          GUI behaviour
        - combine data from different files together (for all file types)
        - increase console functionality
        - increase stability of the new data types and the gui functions
        - review dialogs and old evaluation functions for errors.
        - add convenience functions like fitting of multiple peaks at once or fit of multiple datasets

  v0.8) 
        ? include powder diffractometer format and interface to fullprof ?
        - complete mpms and ppms functionalities for all measurement types
        - complete reflectometer functionalities (don't know what I will do there yet,
          perhaps you have any further ideas?)
        - complete 4circle functionality (don't know that either, perhaps a remote control
          interface for the 4circle for real time measurements with the GUI)
  
  v0.9)
        - Easier, plug in like datatype interface to make development of for others easier.

  v1.0) 
        - get rid of most of the bugs
        - increase usability of the interface (please tell me what is confusing or complicated to use)
        - perhaps making it conform to the GNU license for publication
        - more automated data evaluation functions for the measurement types

Don't expect to much, this is just a loose schedule.
